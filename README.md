# Blorpt - A Note-Taking App

Blorpt is a modern, intuitive note-taking application that allows users to create, draw, save, and share their notes securely. The app supports both local and cloud storage with encrypted data to ensure privacy. It features anonymous sign-in, an easy-to-use canvas for drawing, and the ability to export notes as text or image files.

## Features

- **Anonymous Sign-In**: Sign in as a guest without the need for an account.
- **Text and Drawing Notes**: Write text and draw on a digital canvas.
- **Encryption**: All notes are encrypted before being saved to the cloud to protect user data.
- **Local and Cloud Storage**: Save notes locally or to the cloud with Firebase, with the option to load and edit them later.
- **Export Options**: Export text notes as .txt files and drawings as .png images.
- **Easy Navigation**: A simple and clean user interface with routing for different sections of the app.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Firebase**: Used for authentication and cloud storage.
- **CryptoJS**: Encrypts and decrypts notes before saving them.
- **React Router**: Handles routing for navigation between pages.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for a responsive and modern design.
